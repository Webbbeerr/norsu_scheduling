/**
 * Department Head Access Control Test Scenarios
 * 
 * This file demonstrates how department-based isolation works
 * in the smart scheduling system.
 */

/*
 * TEST SCENARIO 1: Department Head Login
 * ======================================
 * 
 * User: John Doe (john.doe@norsu.edu.ph)
 * Role: Department Head (role = 2)
 * Department: Information Technology (department_id = 1)
 * 
 * EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
 * ✅ Can see: Only IT department faculty
 * ✅ Can see: Only IT department rooms
 * ✅ Can see: Only IT department curricula
 * ❌ Cannot see: Faculty from Engineering, Business, Education departments
 * ❌ Cannot see: Rooms from other departments
 * ❌ Cannot see: Curricula from other departments
 */

/*
 * TEST SCENARIO 2: URL Manipulation Attack
 * =========================================
 * 
 * Department Head: John Doe (IT Department, ID = 1)
 * Attack Attempt: Direct URL access to edit Engineering faculty
 * 
 * URL: /department-head/faculty/999/edit
 * (Faculty ID 999 belongs to Engineering Department, ID = 2)
 * 
 * SECURITY FLOW:
 * 1. DepartmentHeadController::editFaculty(999) is called
 * 2. Controller calls: $this->departmentHeadService->canAccessUser($johnDoe, $faculty999)
 * 3. canAccessUser() checks:
 *    - Is faculty999.departmentId (2) === johnDoe.departmentId (1)? NO
 * 4. Returns: false
 * 5. Controller throws: AccessDeniedException
 * 6. User sees: Flash message "Access denied"
 * 7. Redirected to: /department-head/faculty
 * 
 * RESULT: ✅ ATTACK BLOCKED
 */

/*
 * TEST SCENARIO 3: Cross-Department Room Activation
 * ==================================================
 * 
 * Department Head: Jane Smith (Business Department, ID = 3)
 * Attack Attempt: Activate IT department room
 * 
 * POST: /department-head/rooms/456/activate
 * (Room 456 belongs to IT Department, ID = 1)
 * 
 * SECURITY FLOW:
 * 1. DepartmentHeadController::activateRoom($room456) is called
 * 2. Controller calls: $this->departmentHeadService->validateRoomAccess($janeSmith, $room456)
 * 3. validateRoomAccess() checks:
 *    - Is room456.departmentId (1) === janeSmith.departmentId (3)? NO
 * 4. Throws: AccessDeniedException("You do not have access to this room.")
 * 5. Caught by controller try-catch
 * 6. User sees: Flash message "You do not have access to this room."
 * 7. Redirected to: /department-head/rooms
 * 
 * RESULT: ✅ ATTACK BLOCKED
 */

/*
 * TEST SCENARIO 4: Faculty Creation - Department Auto-Assignment
 * ===============================================================
 * 
 * Department Head: John Doe (IT Department, ID = 1)
 * Action: Create new faculty member
 * 
 * FLOW:
 * 1. Dept Head navigates to: /department-head/faculty/create
 * 2. Controller creates: $user = new User()
 * 3. Controller auto-assigns: $user->setDepartment($johnDoe->getDepartment())
 *    - This sets: $user->department = IT Department (ID = 1)
 * 4. Form is submitted
 * 5. New faculty is saved with department_id = 1
 * 
 * IMPOSSIBILITY: Cannot create faculty for another department
 * Even if attacker modifies form data, the department is set in controller
 * 
 * RESULT: ✅ FACULTY ALWAYS CREATED IN CORRECT DEPARTMENT
 */

/*
 * TEST SCENARIO 5: Dashboard Statistics - Department Filtering
 * =============================================================
 * 
 * Department Head: Alice Johnson (Engineering Department, ID = 2)
 * Page: /department-head/dashboard
 * 
 * SECURITY FLOW:
 * 1. Controller calls: $this->departmentHeadService->getDashboardData($aliceJohnson)
 * 2. getDashboardData() extracts: $deptId = $aliceJohnson->getDepartmentId() // = 2
 * 3. Faculty count query:
 *    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users 
 *    WHERE role = 3 
 *    AND department_id = 2  // ← Engineering only!
 * 4. Room count query:
 *    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rooms 
 *    WHERE department_id = 2  // ← Engineering only!
 * 5. Curriculum count query:
 *    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM curriculum 
 *    WHERE department_id = 2  // ← Engineering only!
 * 
 * DASHBOARD SHOWS:
 * ✅ Total Faculty: 15 (Engineering faculty only)
 * ✅ Total Rooms: 8 (Engineering rooms only)
 * ✅ Total Curricula: 3 (Engineering curricula only)
 * 
 * ❌ DOES NOT SHOW:
 * - IT department faculty (12 members)
 * - Business department rooms (10 rooms)
 * - Education curricula (5 programs)
 * 
 * RESULT: ✅ COMPLETE DEPARTMENT ISOLATION
 */

/*
 * TEST SCENARIO 6: Database-Level Security Verification
 * ======================================================
 * 
 * SQL Query for IT Department Head (John Doe, dept_id = 1):
 * 
 * -- Faculty List Query
 * SELECT * FROM users 
 * WHERE role = 3 
 * AND department_id = 1  -- ✅ Only IT faculty
 * ORDER BY created_at DESC;
 * 
 * -- Rooms List Query
 * SELECT * FROM rooms 
 * WHERE department_id = 1  -- ✅ Only IT rooms
 * ORDER BY code ASC;
 * 
 * -- Curricula List Query
 * SELECT * FROM curriculum 
 * WHERE department_id = 1  -- ✅ Only IT curricula
 * ORDER BY created_at DESC;
 * 
 * IMPOSSIBLE QUERY (blocked by service layer):
 * SELECT * FROM users WHERE role = 3;  -- ❌ No department filter
 * 
 * RESULT: ✅ ALL QUERIES HAVE MANDATORY DEPARTMENT FILTER
 */

/*
 * SECURITY SUMMARY
 * ================
 * 
 * PROTECTION LAYERS:
 * 1. ✅ Role-Based Access Control: #[IsGranted('ROLE_DEPARTMENT_HEAD')]
 * 2. ✅ Department-Scoped Queries: WHERE entity.department_id = :deptId
 * 3. ✅ Resource Ownership Validation: canAccessUser(), validateRoomAccess()
 * 4. ✅ Auto-Assignment on Create: setDepartment($departmentHead->getDepartment())
 * 5. ✅ CSRF Protection: isCsrfTokenValid() on all mutations
 * 
 * ATTACK VECTORS - ALL BLOCKED:
 * ❌ Direct URL manipulation (e.g., /faculty/999/edit)
 * ❌ Parameter tampering (e.g., modifying form POST data)
 * ❌ SQL injection (prevented by Doctrine ORM parameterized queries)
 * ❌ Cross-department data access (filtered at service layer)
 * ❌ CSRF attacks (token validation required)
 * 
 * CONCLUSION:
 * ===========
 * Department heads can ONLY access data within their assigned department.
 * Complete isolation between departments is enforced at multiple layers.
 * No cross-department data leakage is possible.
